	<p>My name is Jesse Stern. I am 27 years old, and I am loving learning how to program! I am from Corvallis, Oregon, and studied music at Portland State University. I moved to the bay area about 3 years ago to study Classical Indian Music at the Ali Akbar College of Music in San Rafael. I started learning how to program in October of 2016. I am super pumped about being in this progam, learning new skills, and meeting new people!</p>
